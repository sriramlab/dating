This tarball contains two programs:
-- computed computes the average pairwise LD as a function of genetic distance. This can then be used to get date estimates by fitting a decay function to the average LD vs distance plot.
-- getposterior computes the corrected date estimates given the uncorrected estimates and estimates of the map error
